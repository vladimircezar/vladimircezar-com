I'm Vladimir Cezar — a hacker, Christian, pilot, and sailor.

This site is my home base for notes, essays, and project write-ups. I care about craftsmanship, resilience, and the quiet details that make systems reliable.

If you're interested in security, aviation, or seamanship, you're in the right place.
