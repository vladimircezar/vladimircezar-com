I’m a software engineer who likes shipping real products and keeping systems clean, fast, and secure. Most of my day job lives in the Apple world, where I build and maintain macOS and software and sweat the details that users never notice but always feel. I’m into cybersecurity and like understanding how things break so I can make them harder to break.

Outside work, I’m a cyberpunk enthusiast who also happens to love old school hobbies. I sail when I can, fly drones for the pure joy of it, and I’m always tinkering with automation, self-hosting, and tools that reduce noise and friction.

I’m a proud dad and a Christian. That keeps me grounded and honest about what matters.

Brazilian by roots, Canadian by life, and always curious about the next problem worth solving.
